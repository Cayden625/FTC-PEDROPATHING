# GitHub Pages Setup - Quick Reference

## 🎯 Make Your Site Live in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

Set **Source** to: `GitHub Actions`

### Step 2: Create Workflow File
1. Go to: https://github.com/Cayden625/FTC-PEDROPATHING
2. Click: `Add file` → `Create new file`
3. Filename: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
4. Copy-paste the workflow code from DEPLOYMENT.md or README.md
5. Click: `Commit changes`

### Step 3: Wait & Access
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
- Visit: https://cayden625.github.io/FTC-PEDROPATHING/

## 🔍 Check Deployment Status
- Go to: https://github.com/Cayden625/FTC-PEDROPATHING/actions
- Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- Green checkmark = Successfully deployed!

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
3. Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
4. Make sure the repository is public (or you have GitHub Pro for private repos)

**If the site doesn't load:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes (first deployment takes longer)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check that the URL is: `https://cayden625.github.io/FTC-PEDROPATHING/`
